**xmpptalk** is a [XMPP][XMPP] bot to make a chatroom writing in Python 3.2+.

Note that it is still in development. It can work well although lacking of some
features, but currently installing it is not quite easy. You may read and try
the `quickinstall.sh` script under `scripts/` directory, but it may fail.

After you set up everything (including the configuration) to run this program,
be sure you run `dbman.py` first.
